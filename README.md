### Building real onchain systems, not demos.

## About

I'm a **blockchain protocol engineer** focused on building **production-grade onchain infrastructure** across emerging ecosystems.

My work centers on:
- Smart contract systems and covenant design  
- Treasury and financial primitives  
- Trust-minimized coordination layers  
- Developer tooling and protocol architecture  

I’m particularly interested in **UTXO-based systems**, **Bitcoin-adjacent ecosystems**, and **next-generation onchain finance primitives**.

---

## Chains & Ecosystems

I’ve built and researched across multiple stacks, with deeper focus on emerging infra layers.

**Primary focus**
- Bitcoin Cash (CashTokens, covenants, UTXO design)
- Stacks / Bitcoin L2 ecosystem
- Ethereum & EVM chains

**Explored**
- zkEVM environments
- Multi-chain contract architecture
- Cross-ecosystem tooling patterns

---

## Notable Work

### FlowGuard
**Covenant-based treasury infrastructure on Bitcoin Cash**

FlowGuard explores how far programmable treasuries can go on UTXO rails — enabling deterministic, onchain-controlled fund management without multisig trust assumptions.

Key areas:
- Covenant-enforced vault logic
- Streaming and treasury automation primitives
- Organization-first onchain coordination
- Developer-facing contract architecture

Positioning: experimental → institutional-grade treasury rails on BCH.

### ChainCircle
Decentralized savings and coordination protocol inspired by ROSCAs, bringing culturally-native finance patterns onchain through smart contract automation.

Focus:
- Trustless savings cycles
- Social coordination primitives
- Multi-chain architecture experiments

## Selected Projects

| Project | Focus | Stack |
|--------|------|------|
| Attest | Onchain agreements and verifiable attestations | Multi-chain research |
| Onchain Resume | Self-sovereign identity experiments | Solidity · IPFS |
| Trade Compounder | Automation across DeFi protocols | TypeScript · Ethers |
| BuilderHub | Builder coordination tooling | React · Node |

---

## Engineering Focus

I care about:
- Deterministic onchain systems
- Minimal trust assumptions
- Clean protocol design
- Composable primitives over apps
- Shipping real implementations, not whitepapers

---

## Current Direction

Lately I’ve been focused on:
- UTXO programmability and covenant design
- Treasury infrastructure and DAO tooling
- Bitcoin-adjacent ecosystems
- Protocol architecture and audits

---

## Open Source

I actively ship experiments, research prototypes, and infrastructure components in public.

Most repos reflect:
- Iterative protocol research
- Hackathon-grade rapid execution
- Systems-first thinking
